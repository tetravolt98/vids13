What do you think about the trend of people making 'relationship goals' a public performance?
    
The age-old question: what's become of romance and relationships in the era of social media. I've seen it firsthand - couples proudly showcasing their love on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, as if the world needs to witness every tender moment they share.It started innocently enough. A couple would post a sweet photo or video of themselves, captioned with something like "Relationship goals!" or "Love is in the air." But over time, it's evolved into a performance – an attempt to get validation and likes from their online followers. The lines between reality TV and real life have blurred.I recall one couple I've observed, who'd post almost every detail of their interactions on Instagram Stories. Their conversations, their dates, even their arguments (which they'd awkwardly staged, it seemed). It was as if they were competing in a bizarre game of "Who Can Be More In Love." The more likes and comments they received, the stronger their relationship appeared.This performance culture has led to an interesting phenomenon: people are now scrutinizing relationships like they're sports events. Everyone's got an opinion on whether couple X is truly in love or just pretending for clout. It's created a toxic environment where people feel pressure to put on a show, rather than genuinely connecting with each other.So, what do I think about this trend? I think it's time we reevaluated our priorities and recognized that relationships are not spectator sports. If you're truly invested in making your relationship work, focus on nurturing the love between you and your partner – not on getting validation from the outside world.
