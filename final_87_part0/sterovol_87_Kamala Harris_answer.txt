What’s your take on people who constantly need validation from their partner?
    
The concept of " validation" has become a buzzword in modern relationships, especially with the rise of social media. I've seen it firsthand – people seeking constant reassurance and approval from their partners, often to the point where it becomes suffocating.I recall a friend's story about his partner, let's call her Sarah. She was always checking for likes on her photos, but not just on social media. Her boyfriend would share stories or achievements online, and she'd constantly need him to comment or share them with their friends. It got to the point where he felt like he had to curate a perfect digital image to make her happy.It wasn't until they attended a couples' workshop that they realized this behavior was an attempt to fill a void within themselves. Sarah grew up in an environment where validation from others was a measure of self-worth, and now she's replicating the same pattern in her relationship.As I reflect on their journey, it made me think about how people seek validation today – through social media likes, online reviews, or even constant praise from our significant others. It's as if we're addicted to that external approval, rather than looking inward for self-acceptance.I'd love to hear your thoughts – have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed someone else's validation? How do you think we can break free from this cycle and focus on building genuine connections with others?
