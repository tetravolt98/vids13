What’s the best way to approach someone about needing space without sounding distant or uncaring?
    
I remember this one conversation I had with my friend Rachel a few years ago. We'd been close since college, but life had gotten busy and we'd drifted apart. I was feeling overwhelmed and needed some time to myself, so I asked her if we could grab coffee.As we sat down at the coffee shop, I told her how much I valued our friendship and that's why I wanted to be upfront with her about needing some space. I explained that it wasn't because I didn't care about her or our friendship, but rather that I was trying to prioritize my own self-care and recharge.I used an analogy from social media – think of it like taking a break from your followers for a bit, just so you can refocus and come back stronger. I told Rachel that I was doing the same thing, taking a digital detox from the world and focusing on myself. It helped her understand that this wasn't about us or our friendship, but more about me needing to take care of my own mental health.Rachel got it, and we talked about how we could still stay connected despite my need for space. We even made a plan to schedule regular check-ins so I wouldn't feel too disconnected. It was a great conversation, and it helped us both understand each other's needs better.
