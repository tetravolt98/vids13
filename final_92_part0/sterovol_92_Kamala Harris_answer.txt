What’s one habit you've seen in your partner that you wish you could adopt?
    
My partner's habit of maintaining a "stop doing" list has been quite inspiring to me. Every quarter, they sit down and reflect on tasks, commitments, or activities that no longer serve them. This exercise helps them reassess priorities, eliminate unnecessary workload, and free up time for more meaningful pursuits.I remember one particular instance when they decided to stop attending a weekly social gathering that had become draining. By acknowledging their energy was better spent elsewhere, they opted out of the event and instead dedicated that time to learning a new skill. The impact was remarkable – they gained a newfound confidence in public speaking and even started leading workshops on that topic.What struck me most about this habit is its simplicity yet profound effect on productivity and happiness. It's not about avoiding responsibilities but rather being intentional with one's energy and resources. I've noticed myself applying similar principles, evaluating tasks that might be holding me back from pursuing my passions.Have you ever taken a step back to assess what activities or commitments you could let go of? Would love to hear your thoughts on this concept!
