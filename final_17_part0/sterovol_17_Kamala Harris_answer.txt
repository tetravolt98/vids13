How do you think Gen Zâ€™s views on mental health will impact future generations?
    
I remember when I first started out as a storyteller, people didn't talk openly about mental health. It was considered taboo, and many suffered in silence. But times have changed, and Gen Z has brought a refreshing openness to the conversation.Growing up with social media, they've seen the pressures of online validation, constant connectivity, and the curated highlight reels that can create unrealistic expectations. This has led them to prioritize self-care, emotional intelligence, and mental well-being from a young age.As I've watched Gen Z navigate their teenage years, I've noticed they're more likely to speak up about their struggles with anxiety, depression, and stress. They're not afraid to take breaks from social media, practice mindfulness, or seek help when needed. This new normal is shaping the way future generations think about mental health.I've seen them create online communities where they can share their experiences, support one another, and break down stigmas surrounding mental illness. They're using platforms like TikTok to raise awareness, reduce shame, and encourage others to prioritize their mental well-being.Gen Z's views on mental health will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on future generations. By normalizing conversations around emotional struggles and promoting self-care, they'll create a ripple effect that influences the way people of all ages think about mental health.As we move forward, I believe Gen Z's influence will lead to:* Increased awareness and understanding of mental health issues* Greater emphasis on mental well-being in education and workplace settings* More innovative approaches to mental health support and resourcesThe conversation has started, but it's not over yet. As storytellers, let's continue to share our experiences, amplify Gen Z's voice, and push the boundaries of what it means to prioritize mental health. What do you think?
