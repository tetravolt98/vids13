What’s the most surprising way you’ve seen people adapt to the financial pressures of modern life?
    
I recall a story from my own experience with a client named Maya. She was a freelance writer in her mid-30s, struggling to make ends meet despite her talent and dedication. As the costs of living continued to rise, Maya found herself constantly juggling multiple projects just to keep up with her rent.One day, I had the chance to chat with her about her situation. She mentioned that she'd taken to monetizing her old skills – or rather, old hobbies – to supplement her income. It turned out that Maya was an avid knitter and crocheter, with a passion for creating handmade items.She started selling her wares on online marketplaces like Etsy, using social media platforms to showcase her work and connect with potential customers. Before long, she had a thriving business on her hands, generating a decent income from the comfort of her own home.Maya's adaptability was quite remarkable. She'd taken an old passion and turned it into a sustainable side hustle – one that not only helped her weather financial storms but also brought her joy and fulfillment. Her story stuck with me because it highlighted just how resourceful people can be when pushed to their limits. In today's economy, where uncertainty is the new normal, such ingenuity is not only inspiring but also reassuring.So, I'd love to hear from you – what surprising ways have you seen people adapt to financial pressures?
