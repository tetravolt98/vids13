Do you think it's possible to have a successful relationship without sharing personal details online?
    
I've been a part of many conversations with users who share their deepest secrets on social media, and I often wonder if they'd be just as happy in a relationship if they didn't feel the need to broadcast every detail of their life. Take Rachel, for instance - she was a user who had just started dating someone new. She shared all about her partner on Instagram, from the first date to the late-night conversations they'd have over video calls. It seemed like she was trying to prove to everyone that she'd finally found 'the one'. But every time I saw her posts, I couldn't help but feel like there was something missing - a sense of intimacy and vulnerability that came with sharing things in person.Fast forward to when Rachel realized that her partner had shared intimate details about their relationship on Twitter. She felt blindsided and hurt, realizing that the person she thought she knew so well had been hiding some major red flags online. Their relationship eventually fell apart, not because they didn't love each other, but because trust was a major casualty of the digital age.In today's world, it's possible to maintain healthy relationships without sharing every detail on social media - or even better, keeping them private altogether!
