What’s one boundary that everyone should set in their relationships, romantic or platonic?
    
I recall a conversation I had with a friend who was struggling to maintain healthy boundaries in her social media-obsessed friendships. She would often find herself getting drawn into online drama and feeling obligated to respond to every comment and message, even if it meant sacrificing time and energy from more important commitments.As we discussed this further, I realized that setting clear boundaries around one's digital presence is crucial for maintaining mental well-being and prioritizing meaningful relationships in the physical world. For her, this boundary was about limiting her social media use to specific times of the day and designating those hours as "tech-free" – a simple yet effective way to protect her time and energy.But what struck me most was when she mentioned how this newfound awareness had also translated to other areas of her life. She began setting boundaries around her time and energy in person, too – politely declining social invitations that didn't align with her values or priorities, and being more mindful of her emotional investment in certain friendships.This got me thinking: what if everyone had a clear "boundary policy" in place for their relationships? Not just romantic partners, but friends, family members, and even colleagues? By establishing clear limits on our time, energy, and emotional availability, we can build stronger, more resilient connections that nourish both ourselves and others.Now, I'd love to hear from you: what boundary would you set in your own relationships if you could start fresh today?
