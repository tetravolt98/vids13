What do you think about the idea of 'emotional cheating' versus physical cheating?
    
The age-old conundrum of emotional cheating. I've seen it play out in many a digital drama, where people's online personas blur the lines between platonic and romantic connections.In my experience, emotional cheating can be just as damaging – if not more so – than physical infidelity. It starts with innocent conversations on social media or messaging apps, where you confide in someone who makes you feel seen and heard. Before long, these digital chats escalate into deep, meaningful exchanges that leave you feeling connected to this person on a level that's hard to ignore.The thing is, emotional cheating can be subtle and insidious. You might not even realize it's happening until you're already invested in the connection. And by then, it's often too late – your feelings have been awakened, and the line between friendship and romance has become hopelessly blurred.I recall a conversation I had with a friend who was struggling with this exact issue. She'd started chatting with someone on Instagram, just as friends, but soon found herself feeling drawn to him in ways she couldn't explain. As they exchanged more intimate details about their lives, the boundaries between friendship and romance began to dissolve.The question is, where do you draw the line? Can a digital connection ever truly be platonic? I think it's time we had a conversation about what emotional cheating means to us – not just in our personal relationships, but also online. What are your thoughts on this matter?
