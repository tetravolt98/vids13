What’s the most toxic thing about modern relationships that people often ignore?
    
I've seen it happen time and time again – couples getting caught up in the whirlwind of social media validation. It's like they're competing in a never-ending game of "Who's Got the Most Followers" or "Whose Relationship is More Instagrammable." They present this curated, highlight-reel version of their relationship to the world, but what about when the cameras stop rolling? When the pressure to maintain this perfect facade starts to take its toll on their mental health and real relationships?I recall a friend who started dating someone new. At first, it was all sunshine and rainbows – the posts, the likes, the comments. But behind closed doors, I saw them struggling with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. They felt like they needed to constantly perform for their partner's approval, rather than being themselves. It was suffocating.And then there are the couples who use social media as a way to one-up each other. "Oh, you posted about your vacation? Well, let me top that with my exotic getaway." It's this toxic cycle of comparison and competition, where they're more focused on impressing their online followers than nurturing genuine intimacy.It's time for us to acknowledge the elephant in the room – the way we present our relationships on social media is often more about ego-stroking than real connection. Let's be honest with ourselves and each other: true love doesn't need validation from strangers; it stands on its own merit.What do you think? Are there any modern relationship dynamics that you feel are getting overlooked?
