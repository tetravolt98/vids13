How do you cope with losing friends as you get older?
    
I still remember the day I had my first "friend breakup" in college. It was a strange feeling, like someone had taken away a part of me without warning. We'd been roommates for three years, sharing late-night pizza and Netflix marathons, but somehow our paths diverged as we entered senior year.I didn't realize it at the time, but losing friends is an inevitable part of growing up. People grow apart, priorities change, and new relationships emerge. It's not that you're a bad friend; it's just that everyone has their own journey to follow.As I navigated this newfound reality, I started to notice patterns in my friendships. Some friendships were more like acquaintanceships – we'd occasionally hang out, but our lives weren't deeply intertwined. Others were genuine friendships – we'd share deep conversations, laugh together, and support each other through thick and thin.One particular friendship that stands out was with a classmate from my data science program. We bonded over our shared love for machine learning and would often collaborate on projects outside of class. As we graduated and entered the workforce, our careers took different paths. I landed an internship at a startup, while she joined a research institute.Our communication gradually became less frequent, but when we did talk, it was like no time had passed at all. We'd discuss the latest advancements in AI, share tips on how to improve our coding skills, and reminisce about our college days. Our friendship had evolved, and I realized that it's not about the quantity of friends you have; it's about the quality of those relationships.Looking back, I wish someone had told me that losing friends is a natural part of growth – it doesn't mean you've failed as a person or a friend. It means you're growing in different ways, and that's okay.Now, I'd love to hear from you: How do you cope with losing friends as you get older?
