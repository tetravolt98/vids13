What’s one thing that could make online dating more authentic?
    
The world of online dating – it's a brave new frontier, isn't it? I've had my fair share of experiences in this realm. Let me tell you about one thing that could make online dating more authentic: video chat requirements for meaningful interactions.I recall a conversation I had with a friend who met someone special on a dating app. They exchanged messages and even took their relationship to the phone call level, but never quite progressed beyond it. That's when I realized that, in today's digital age, we often rely too heavily on virtual connections.One evening, as I was watching a YouTube video, I stumbled upon an interview with a matchmaker who suggested that requiring participants to engage in video chats before meeting in person could be a game-changer. The idea is simple: it forces people to put themselves out there, to show their authentic selves, and not just hide behind a screen.Imagine if dating apps implemented a rule where you couldn't progress beyond a certain level unless you'd had a meaningful video chat with your match. It would encourage genuine connections, promote vulnerability, and ultimately lead to more meaningful relationships.Now, I'm not saying it's an easy sell – we've all been guilty of swiping through profiles without really thinking twice about who's on the other end. But, if we could make online dating a bit more authentic, wouldn't that be something? The next time you're browsing through potential matches, remember: there's a real person behind every profile picture, and video chatting can help bridge that gap. What do you think?
