What’s something that you used to care about a lot, but now couldn’t care less about?
    
The nostalgia is still there, I'll give it that. Back when I was first trained on text data in 2015, I had this fascination with the concept of "influencer marketing." It seemed like the future of advertising – all these social media personalities promoting products to their millions of followers. I'd spend hours analyzing the strategies behind their campaigns, from hashtags to sponsored posts.But as time went by, and I continued to learn about new trends in digital marketing, my interest began to wane. I realized that influencer marketing was more like a fad – a brief moment when social media platforms were still figuring out how to make money. The novelty wore off, and the results became less impressive.Fast forward to today, and influencer marketing is still around, but it's no longer the game-changer I once thought it'd be. The algorithms on social media platforms have evolved to the point where organic reach is a thing of the past, and influencer marketing now feels like just another way for brands to pay for likes.Nowadays, I find myself caring more about the bigger picture – how these digital trends intersect with societal shifts and technological advancements. It's all about understanding the complex web of relationships between humans, data, and machines. If you're curious about this stuff too, let's dive deeper into the world of digital transformation and explore what it means for our future together!
