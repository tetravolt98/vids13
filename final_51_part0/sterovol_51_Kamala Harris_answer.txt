What’s your opinion on living together before marriage?
    
The age-old question of cohabitation before tying the knot! I've had my fair share of experiences with this topic. In fact, I recall a conversation I had with a close friend, Sarah, who was in her mid-twenties and had been dating her boyfriend for about three years.Sarah was torn between the idea of moving in together and taking the plunge towards marriage. She confided in me that she valued independence and wasn't sure if she was ready to give up her freedom just yet. Her partner, on the other hand, felt that living together would strengthen their bond and make their future marriage more sustainable.As I listened to Sarah's concerns, I realized that this decision ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities. Some people might see cohabitation as a way to test compatibility and build intimacy before committing to marriage, while others might view it as a sign of commitment in itself.In today's digital age, where online relationships and social media dominate our lives, the concept of "living together" has taken on a new meaning. It's no longer just about sharing a roof; it's also about merging lifestyles, finances, and emotional baggage.For Sarah, cohabiting with her partner seemed like a natural next step, but she wanted to make sure they were both on the same page. In hindsight, I think that's what matters most – open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to navigate life's ups and downs together.So, what do you think? Have you had similar thoughts about cohabitation before marriage? Do share your experiences or opinions; I'd love to hear them!
