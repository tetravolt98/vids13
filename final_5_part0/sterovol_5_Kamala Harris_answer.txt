Whatâ€™s a red flag that you now look for in a potential partner that you never used to?
    
As I reflect on my experiences, I've come to realize that one red flag I now look for in a potential partner is inconsistency between their online and offline behavior. It started when I began dating someone who had an impressive social media presence - they were always out and about, attending events, and seemed to have a full, exciting life.However, our first few dates were underwhelming. They'd cancel plans at the last minute, or show up late without explanation. When I confronted them about it, they'd simply shrug it off, saying they had "just gotten busy" or that something unexpected came up.As I continued to date this person, I noticed a pattern: their online presence was always polished and curated, while their offline behavior was lackluster. It made me realize that consistency is key in any relationship - if someone can't be bothered to show up on time or follow through on commitments, what other areas of life might they be inconsistent in?This experience taught me to pay closer attention to the alignment between someone's online persona and their offline actions. I've since applied this lesson to future relationships, and it's helped me avoid potential heartaches.What about you? Have you ever encountered a similar situation, or learned any valuable lessons about red flags in potential partners?
