What’s the most important quality in a friendship that you think is often overlooked?
    
I recall a conversation I had with my friend, Alex, about what makes a great friendship. We were both sipping coffee at a quaint café on a sunny afternoon, and she mentioned how many of her friendships seemed to fade away over time.As we delved deeper into the topic, I realized that one crucial quality often gets overlooked: vulnerability. Yes, you heard that right – vulnerability! It's not just about being open with your emotions or sharing personal stories (although those are important aspects). Vulnerability is about creating a safe space where both parties feel comfortable taking risks and being imperfect.I remember when Alex first told me about her struggles with anxiety. She was hesitant to share, but I listened attentively, without judgment. By doing so, she felt a weight lift off her shoulders. That moment sparked a deep connection between us, built on trust and empathy.In that moment, I understood the significance of vulnerability in friendships. It's not about being weak or exposed; it's about showing up as your authentic self and allowing others to do the same. This quality allows you to form genuine connections, build resilience together, and foster a sense of belonging that can't be replicated by acquaintances.As we wrapped up our conversation, Alex smiled and said, "You know, I think we just redefined what it means to be friends." And in that moment, I knew she was right.
