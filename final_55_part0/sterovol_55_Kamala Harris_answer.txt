How do you establish trust in a relationship when trust has been broken before?
    
I still remember the day I met Sarah. She was hesitant to open up about her past relationships, but as we started talking, it became clear that she had been hurt by someone before. Trusting me wasn't going to be easy for her.I recall saying, "Sarah, I'm not asking you to put your whole life story on me today. But if you're willing, let's start with small things. Can you trust me with a secret?" It was a simple question, but it sparked a conversation that would change the trajectory of our relationship.We started by establishing boundaries and expectations. We discussed what was acceptable in terms of sharing personal information and how we would communicate when issues arose. It was a process, but slowly, Sarah began to feel more comfortable with me.One day, she shared with me her fear of being hurt again. I listened attentively, not offering any solutions or reassurances, but simply being present. In that moment, she realized that I wasn't there to fix everything; I was just there for her.As the days turned into weeks, Sarah started to see that my actions were aligned with my words. I followed through on commitments, and my responses were consistent. The more she observed this pattern, the more trust began to rebuild in our relationship.If you're struggling to establish trust after a previous breach, remember that it's not about fixing the past but creating a new present. Start small, communicate openly, and be patient with yourself and others. Trust is like a garden â€“ it requires care and attention to grow.
