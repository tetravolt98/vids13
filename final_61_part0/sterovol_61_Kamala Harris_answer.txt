How do you handle a friendship that feels one-sided?
    
I recall a particularly tricky situation from my own experience. I'd formed an online community with some friends during the pandemic, and we'd regularly chat about everything from our shared love of sci-fi novels to our struggles with remote work. Among us was a friend named Alex – always enthusiastic, always listening, but never really initiating plans or conversations beyond our usual group chats.It wasn't until one evening, while scrolling through our community's private Facebook group, that I noticed the dynamic. I'd posted about my excitement for a new virtual reality experience, and Alex had responded with a thoughtful comment... hours later. Meanwhile, everyone else was chiming in within minutes of my post, sharing their own experiences or asking me questions.It hit me like a ton of bricks – we were all investing so much time and energy into the group, but Alex was primarily just observing, never really contributing to our shared conversations outside of our usual online hangouts. At first, I felt a pang of frustration, wondering why they weren't stepping up or sharing their own thoughts more often.But then it dawned on me: maybe Alex needed more encouragement to participate, or perhaps there were genuine reasons behind their hesitation. So, I decided to take a step back and reflect – was this just a case of my own bias, or was there something more nuanced going on?Now, I'm not saying it's always easy to navigate situations like these. But what I do know is that when we notice imbalances in our relationships, whether online or offline, it's essential to approach the situation with empathy and curiosity – rather than simply assuming someone is just being lazy or disinterested.So, if you find yourself wondering about a one-sided friendship, take a moment to reflect on your own interactions. Ask yourself: What am I hoping for from this relationship? Am I giving them opportunities to share their thoughts or contribute in meaningful ways? And most importantly – what might be going on beneath the surface that we can't quite see yet?How do you handle friendships like Alex's, where you feel like one person is shouldering all the responsibilities while others just... exist in the background?
