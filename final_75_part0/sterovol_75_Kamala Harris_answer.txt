Whatâ€™s the worst dating advice you've ever received?
    
The worst dating advice I've ever received was from my well-meaning but slightly outdated aunt. She told me that if a guy doesn't call or text within 24 hours after a date, it's a sign that he's not interested and I should just move on to the next one.I had just met this really cute guy online, and we'd had a great conversation over coffee. He seemed nice, but maybe a bit shy? So, I was excited when my aunt shared her wisdom with me. I told him it was no big deal if he didn't call or text right away, that I wouldn't read too much into it.But then... nothing happened for two whole days! No texts, no calls, no nothing. And I'm sitting here thinking to myself, "Oh dear, I think Aunt's advice might have been a bit off..."Fast forward to the next day when he finally messaged me out of the blue, saying he'd lost my number (yeah, right!) and wanted to grab coffee again. We ended up having an amazing second date, but not before I'd been thoroughly confused by his non-response.In hindsight, maybe Aunt's advice was just a bit too simplistic? Maybe we should just focus on getting to know someone as an individual, rather than putting so much stock in these arbitrary "rules"? What do you think?
