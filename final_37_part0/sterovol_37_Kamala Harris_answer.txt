What’s one habit that made a huge difference in improving your mental health?
    
The habit that's had the most significant impact on my mental well-being is journaling. I know it sounds simple, but trust me, it's been a game-changer. About three years ago, I was feeling overwhelmed with work and personal commitments. I felt like I was constantly juggling multiple balls in the air, and if one dropped, everything would come crashing down.One evening, as I was winding down before bed, I stumbled upon an old Moleskine notebook that had been collecting dust on my shelf for years. On a whim, I decided to start writing down my thoughts, feelings, and experiences from the day. I started with just bullet points – the things I needed to remember for work tomorrow, appointments, and grocery shopping.But as time went on, my journaling evolved. I began to write about my emotions, what triggered anxiety or stress, and how I managed those feelings. It was therapeutic, in a way. By putting pen to paper (or finger to screen), I could process my thoughts and reflect on the day's events.Now, journaling is an essential part of my daily routine. I set aside 15 minutes each morning to write down my goals, affirmations, and gratitudes. It helps me clarify my priorities, work through challenges, and appreciate the little things in life.If you're struggling with mental health or feeling overwhelmed like I was, I encourage you to give journaling a try. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or coherence – just write from the heart. You'd be surprised at how therapeutic it can be! What's one habit that you've developed to improve your mental well-being?
