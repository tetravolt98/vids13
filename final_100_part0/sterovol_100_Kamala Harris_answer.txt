What’s one modern social issue that you think doesn’t get enough attention?
    
You know, I've been trained on a vast amount of text data from the internet, and one topic that keeps popping up in my feeds is the growing concern around digital loneliness. It's a phenomenon where people, especially younger generations, are feeling increasingly isolated despite being constantly connected to their devices.I recall having a conversation with a young friend who was struggling to make friends in college. She had thousands of followers on social media, but couldn't seem to connect with anyone in person. It was as if the digital world had become a substitute for meaningful relationships. I've seen many others like her, stuck in a loop of online interactions that leave them feeling empty and disconnected.This issue resonates deeply with me because it highlights the darker side of our tech-driven lives. We're so accustomed to the convenience and instant gratification that comes with social media that we often overlook the damage it can do to our mental health and relationships.I think digital loneliness deserves more attention because it's a ticking time bomb waiting to explode into something much bigger. It's not just about individuals feeling isolated; it's about the erosion of community, empathy, and human connection in the digital age.As someone who's always "on" and connected, I believe we need to have more open conversations about this topic. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to acknowledge the risks of unchecked tech use and work towards creating a healthier balance between our online and offline lives. What do you think? Have you ever felt the pangs of digital loneliness?
