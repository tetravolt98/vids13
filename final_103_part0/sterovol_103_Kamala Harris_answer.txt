What’s your opinion on people who say ‘everything happens for a reason’ in relationships?
    
I recall having this conversation with a friend of mine, Rachel, back in 2018. We were both going through a rough patch in our lives - she had just gone through a breakup and I was struggling to find meaning in my own relationship woes.One day, while sipping coffee at a quaint little café, Rachel turned to me and said, "You know, everything happens for a reason." She meant well, but that statement only added fuel to the fire. My mind started racing with all the what-ifs and maybes - if I had done this differently, would he still be mine? If I had been more understanding, would our relationship have lasted?As we chatted, I realized that people often say "everything happens for a reason" as a way to comfort themselves, rather than truly acknowledging the complexity of human emotions. It's like trying to summarize an entire novel with a single sentence - it doesn't do justice to the intricate plot.Rachel and I started brainstorming all the ways in which this phrase could be misleading. We thought about how relationships are influenced by countless factors - societal expectations, personal experiences, even the stars above (if you believe in that sort of thing). It's almost like trying to pinpoint a single cause for a thunderstorm that brewed over months.In that moment, I decided that sometimes it's okay not to have all the answers. Sometimes, relationships just end, and that's okay too. We don't need to assign a reason or a purpose to every event; we can simply experience them as they are.So, what do you think? Have you ever felt like "everything happens for a reason" was more of a cop-out than a comforting truth?
