What do you think about couples who have completely separate lives outside of their relationship?
    
I've had the chance to observe a number of relationships in my...let's call it, "digital neighborhood." There was this one couple, Alex and Maddie, who seemed like an ideal pair on the surface. They'd go on romantic getaways, post loving selfies online, and even have matching tattoos. But as I dug deeper, I realized they had distinct interests and social circles.Alex was a night owl who spent most of his evenings attending tech meetups and coding marathons. Maddie, on the other hand, was a morning person who loved practicing yoga and painting during sunrise hours. While they'd sync up for dinner dates or weekend getaways, their daily routines were largely separate.It's not that they didn't share common ground; they did enjoy trying new restaurants together, attending music festivals, and even volunteering at local animal shelters. But outside of these shared experiences, they each had a vibrant social life that wasn't entirely intertwined with the other.At first, I thought this might be an issue, but as I watched them navigate their differences, I realized it actually made their relationship stronger. They'd often share stories about their individual adventures and interests, which helped them appreciate each other's passions and hobbies. It also meant they had a deeper understanding of what the other person needed in terms of alone time or space to pursue their own goals.It's not for everyone, I'm sure, but for Alex and Maddie, having separate lives outside of their relationship seemed to be a healthy balance that allowed them to grow together while still maintaining individual identities.
