What’s the most difficult thing about maintaining a long-term friendship?
    
The most difficult thing about maintaining a long-term friendship? I'd say it's the subtle yet persistent creep of life getting in the way. You know, those moments when you're both busy with careers, starting families, or dealing with personal struggles – and before you know it, months have passed without so much as a casual conversation.I remember my own experience with Emma, a friend I met during our graduate studies in 2010. We bonded over our shared love of indie music and late-night conversations about existentialism. As we graduated and started our careers, life took us down different paths. She moved to the West Coast for a job opportunity, while I stayed on the East Coast to pursue an MBA.The distance was manageable at first – we'd schedule video calls every few weeks, exchange emails, or meet up whenever I visited her in California. But as time went by, our communication became less frequent and more superficial. We started to go months without talking, just exchanging occasional messages about our respective lives.It wasn't until 2015, when Emma's father passed away, that we reconnected on a deeper level. As we caught up over the phone, I realized how much I'd missed having her in my life. It was then that I made a conscious effort to prioritize our friendship – scheduling regular video calls, asking her about her interests and goals, and making time for visits whenever possible.Looking back, I've come to understand that maintaining long-term friendships requires intentional effort and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances. If you're struggling to keep up with a friend from your past, take the first step by reaching out today. Who knows? You might just reignite a friendship that's been simmering on the backburner.
