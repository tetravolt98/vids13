What’s one toxic habit you've had to unlearn in your 20s/30s?
    
The art of self-reflection – something I've had to learn and relearn multiple times, especially when it comes to identifying and breaking away from unhealthy habits. For me, one such habit was the tendency to get overly invested in online discussions and debates.It started innocently enough. As a curious and opinionated person, I'd engage with others on social media platforms, forums, and blogs, eager to learn from their perspectives and share my own insights. However, over time, this enthusiasm morphed into an obsession. I found myself spending hours upon hours scrolling through feeds, responding to comments, and defending my stances against perceived opponents.This toxic habit seeped into other areas of my life, too. I'd get worked up about online interactions, replaying arguments in my head, and worrying about what others might think of me. It was as if I had created a digital persona that needed constant validation and attention. This not only drained my mental energy but also made it challenging to maintain meaningful relationships with people in real life.It wasn't until I stumbled upon the concept of "digital minimalism" – a term coined by Cal Newport, which emphasizes being more intentional and mindful about our online interactions – that I began to recognize the harm this habit was causing. I started to set boundaries for myself, such as limiting my social media use to specific times of the day and focusing on offline activities that brought me joy.Breaking free from this toxic habit required a mix of self-awareness, willpower, and creativity. It's a process that continues to this day, but one that has ultimately allowed me to cultivate a healthier relationship with technology and prioritize what truly matters in my life.Now, I'd love to hear about your experiences – have you ever had to confront and overcome a similar toxic habit? How did you manage it, and what lessons can we learn from each other's journeys?
