What's a modern dating trend that you find completely overrated?
    
The world of modern dating - it's a brave new frontier, indeed! As someone who's been around long enough to see the rise and fall of various trends, I have to say that one thing that leaves me scratching my head is the phenomenon of "ghosting."You know, when someone you're interested in disappears into thin air without so much as a "Hey, it wasn't working out for me"? Yeah, that's just plain rude. And don't even get me started on the ghosters themselves - are they really too afraid to face rejection head-on? Do they think that by simply vanishing, they're avoiding an awkward conversation?I recall one particular instance where I was matched with someone on a popular dating app. We had a great conversation going for a few days, and I thought things were looking up. But then... poof! They vanished into the digital ether without a word. No explanation, no apology - just gone.It's not just about me, either. Friends of mine have reported similar experiences with ghosters who seem to think that they're doing them a favor by letting them down easy. Newsflash: it's not a favor; it's basic human decency. So, here's my take: if you're going to swipe left on someone, at least have the courage to say goodbye.Now, I'd love to hear from you - what do you think about ghosting? Have you ever been on the receiving end of this modern dating faux pas?
