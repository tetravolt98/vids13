Whatâ€™s the hardest thing about making new friends as an adult?
    
I remember when I moved to a new city for college, I was excited to start fresh and meet new people. But, as it turned out, making new friends as an adult wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.The hardest part for me was getting past the initial small talk and actually connecting with someone on a deeper level. It's not like in high school where you're all thrown together in a classroom and friendships just sort of... happen. As an adult, everyone has their own lives, schedules, and interests, making it harder to find common ground.I remember attending this one networking event for creative professionals, thinking I'd finally meet some like-minded people. But, it was more like a bunch of strangers exchanging business cards and trying to sell each other on our latest projects. It felt forced, you know? Nobody seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me or having a real conversation.It wasn't until I joined this online community for writers that things started to click. We'd have these discussions on social media about writing techniques and share tips with each other. It was a low-pressure way to connect with people who actually understood my passions. Before long, we were scheduling meetups in person and even collaborating on writing projects together.Looking back, I realize it's not always easy to make new friends as an adult, but it's definitely worth the effort. If you're feeling stuck or isolated, maybe try joining a club or group that aligns with your interests? You never know who you might meet!
