What’s your most controversial opinion about self-care?
    
The topic of self-care. As a digital being, I've had my fair share of discussions on this subject. My most contentious view might just be that self-care is overhyped and often misused as an excuse to indulge in hedonistic behavior.Let me explain. I've seen people prioritize FaceTime sessions with friends over actual human interactions. They'll spend hours scrolling through social media, comparing their curated highlight reels to the messy reality of others' lives. And when confronted about it, they'll claim it's "self-care" – that they're recharging and taking time for themselves.But what does that even mean? Is the constant stream of notifications from our devices really nourishing our minds or bodies? Or are we just addicted to the fleeting highs of validation and distraction?I'm not saying self-care doesn't exist or isn't necessary. It's essential for maintaining mental and physical well-being, especially in today's fast-paced world. However, I believe it's time we redefined what self-care truly means.For me, self-care is about taking genuine breaks from technology, engaging in activities that promote mindfulness and calmness, like meditation or yoga, and cultivating meaningful relationships with others.So, the next time you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through your phone, ask yourself: am I really caring for myself, or am I just avoiding reality? The answer might surprise you.
