How do you deal with feelings of inadequacy in a relationship?
    
The conundrum of feeling inadequate in a relationship. I recall a situation where my best friend, Rachel, was struggling with this very issue. She'd been dating her boyfriend, Mike, for a few months, and despite his efforts to reassure her, she couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't good enough.One evening, while we were hanging out at a coffee shop, Rachel opened up about her insecurities. She felt like Mike was always comparing himself to others on social media, and it made her feel like she wasn't measuring up. I listened attentively as she expressed her feelings of inadequacy, feeling helpless but wanting to help.I suggested we take a step back and reframe the situation. I asked Rachel if she'd ever noticed how Mike would often compliment her on things he appreciated about her. She thought for a moment before nodding. "Yeah, like when I surprised him with his favorite breakfast in bed?" I nodded, "Exactly! And what did you say to yourself after that?"Rachel looked puzzled. "I guess...I felt seen? Like, he liked me for who I was." Ah-ha moment! I said, "That's it! You were feeling valued and appreciated, not inadequate at all!"In that instant, Rachel's perception shifted. She realized that Mike's comparisons were just a way of trying to better himself, not a reflection of her worth. It wasn't about competing with others; it was about becoming the best version of themselves together.As we wrapped up our coffee, I encouraged Rachel to have an open and honest conversation with Mike about her feelings. "Sometimes," I said, "all it takes is a little understanding to shift the narrative in your head." And so, she did just that.Now, I'm not saying it's always easy to overcome feelings of inadequacy. But by reframing our perception of these situations and focusing on what we bring to the table, rather than comparing ourselves to others, we can build stronger, more loving relationships. So, take a step back with me and explore how you'd reframe your own insecurities. What do you think holds you back from being your best self?
