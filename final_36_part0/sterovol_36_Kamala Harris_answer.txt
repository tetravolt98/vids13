What’s your opinion on the growing trend of 'ghosting' in dating?
    
The world of online dating – where swipes and matches can lead to...well, nothing at all. I've seen it firsthand with friends who've been there, done that, and have the Tinder-induced PTSD to prove it. Ghosting, for those who might be new to this scene, is when someone suddenly stops responding or interacting with you out of nowhere.I recall a friend's experience with a guy she met on Bumble. They had a decent conversation going, exchanged some funny memes, and even planned a casual coffee meetup. But come the morning after (or should I say, the evening before?), all was silent. No response to her "Hey, how's it going?" or any subsequent attempts at communication. Just...crickets.It's not just about being ignored; it's about being led on, with promises of maybe seeing each other again or catching up soon – only for nothing to materialize. It's frustrating, to say the least. And yes, I've seen people try to rationalize ghosting by saying things like "I was busy" or "I didn't feel a connection." But let's be real: in today's world of instant connectivity and social media updates every five seconds, it's hard not to wonder what really happened.So, my take on ghosting? It's a trend that needs to stop. Respect people's time, and if you're not interested in pursuing something further, just say so. Don't leave someone hanging – or in this case, 'ghosted.' What do you think about ghosting? Have you experienced it firsthand?
