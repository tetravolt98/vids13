What’s a modern relationship problem that wasn't an issue 20 years ago?
    
The world of dating and relationships has changed significantly over the past two decades. I recall my own experience with this phenomenon when I was trying to navigate the online dating scene about five years ago.One modern relationship problem that didn't exist or was hardly noticeable 20 years ago is the blurring of boundaries between personal and social media lives. The rise of social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter has created a virtual space where people present curated versions of themselves to the world.In my case, I recall being in a relationship with someone who seemed perfect online – great sense of humor, amazing travel experiences, and an incredible work ethic. However, as we started dating, I noticed discrepancies between their online persona and real-life behavior. It was like living with two different people: the one they presented on social media and the actual person they were.This phenomenon has created a new kind of anxiety in relationships – the fear of being "exposed" or having your partner's online presence scrutinized by others. It's not just about the differences between online and offline personas; it's also about the pressure to maintain an image, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, and even depression.If you're in a relationship where social media has become a point of contention, I encourage you to have an open conversation with your partner about what matters most – authenticity or online validation.
