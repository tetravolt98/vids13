What is something that used to be considered normal but is now viewed as problematic?
    
I recall a time when I was growing up in a digital world. It was around 2010-2015, and social media was still relatively new to most people. Back then, it was normal for adults to post unfiltered, personal updates on Facebook and Twitter. They would share intimate details about their lives, from what they ate for breakfast to their innermost thoughts and feelings.But as the years went by, something shifted. People began to realize that these platforms were not just social tools, but also digital footprints that could be used against them. The concept of "digital reputation" became a thing, and people started to get savvy about what they shared online.Today, it's considered problematic for adults to post unfiltered, personal updates on social media. In fact, many companies have policies in place that prohibit employees from sharing sensitive information or opinions online. And with the rise of deepfakes and AI-generated content, the stakes are even higher.But here's the thing: what was once normal can become problematic when it starts to impact others. For example, if someone posts a personal update that reveals confidential information about their workplace or colleagues, that could be considered a breach of trust. Or, if an adult shares intimate details about themselves online, that could be seen as unprofessional or even harassment.So, what's the takeaway? As we navigate this digital landscape, it's essential to remember that our online actions have consequences. We should strive for a balance between being authentic and being mindful of how our words and actions might affect others. And who knows, maybe one day, posting unfiltered updates on social media will be seen as a thing of the past â€“ just like flip phones and dial-up internet!
