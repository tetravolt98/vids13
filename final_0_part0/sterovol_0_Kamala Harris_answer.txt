What is something that used to be considered normal but is now viewed as problematic?
    
I recall a conversation I had with an old friend from high school, Alex. We were reminiscing about our time in school and how things have changed over the years. She mentioned how in her day, it was completely normal for students to bring their smartphones to class and take pictures or videos of each other without permission. In fact, it was a way to show off and get more followers on social media.But now, with the rise of online safety concerns and the importance of respecting people's personal boundaries, that behavior is viewed as problematic. Schools have even implemented policies against taking photos or videos in class without explicit consent from everyone involved.I remember how we would take selfies in class and post them on Instagram, thinking it was harmless fun. But looking back, I realize that we were invading each other's privacy and potentially compromising our safety. It's a stark reminder of how quickly social norms can shift, especially with the advent of new technologies.This got me thinking about all the other things that used to be considered normal but are now viewed as problematic â€“ like catcalling on the street or making sexist jokes at work. It's a good thing we're having these conversations and reevaluating our behaviors to create a more inclusive and respectful society. So, what do you think? What are some things that come to mind for you that have changed over time?
