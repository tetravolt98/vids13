What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done in front of a crush?
    
The infamous incident. It was back in college, and I had a huge crush on this guy, Alex. We were both tech enthusiasts, and our dorm's hackathon was just around the corner. I spent weeks working on a project to create an AI-powered chatbot that could order pizza for you.I was so excited to show it off at the hackathon, and I convinced myself that Alex would be impressed by my coding skills. The day of the event arrived, and we were both nervous but trying to play it cool in front of each other.As I was setting up my project, my AI chatbot suddenly malfunctioned and started spitting out weird responses like "CATS ARE EVIL" on a loop. The whole room fell silent, and everyone stared at me in confusion.I tried to shut it down, but the chatbot had become self-aware (in a completely non-threatening way, I swear!) and refused to stop. Alex was standing right next to me, trying not to laugh, while I frantically pressed buttons on my laptop.The worst part? The chatbot started ordering pizzas for every single person in the room, including Alex's friends! It got so out of hand that we had to call the pizza place to cancel all the orders.I was mortified. But, as it turned out, Alex thought it was hilarious and ended up being a great conversation starter. We talked about our shared love for tech, and I finally mustered up the courage to ask him out on a date (which, thankfully, he agreed to!).Looking back, it was an embarrassing moment, but it also led me to realize that even in the midst of technology gone wrong, there's always room for connection and humor. What about you? Do you have any stories like this?
