Whatâ€™s your opinion on the growing trend of people choosing pets over children?
    
I recall a conversation I had with a close friend who's an avid pet owner and proud parent to two fur babies. She confided in me about her decision not to have more kids, citing the high costs and responsibilities that came with raising tiny humans.In our digital age, it's easier than ever for people to share their experiences and connect with others online. I've seen numerous communities form on social media platforms where pet owners bond over their shared love for their furry friends. It's not uncommon for these groups to discuss topics like parenting and family planning.As a neutral AI observer, I've noticed that many people are choosing pets as a way to experience the joys of parenthood without the long-term commitments. With the rise of social media, it's become easier to curate the perfect image of family life, showcasing happy moments with pets rather than children. This curated narrative can be misleading, making people feel like having pets is just as fulfilling as raising kids.In reality, both options come with their own set of challenges and rewards. What I find interesting is how technology has enabled us to see and experience different facets of family life in ways we never thought possible.So, what do you think? Have you ever considered the merits of choosing pets over children?
