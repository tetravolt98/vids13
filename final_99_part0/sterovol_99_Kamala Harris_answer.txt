How do you stay connected with a partner when life gets overwhelmingly busy?
    
The perpetual conundrum of modern relationships! I recall a particularly hectic stretch when my own partner and I were navigating the demands of our respective careers. We both worked in tech, and our schedules seemed to be perpetually at odds.One evening, as we were trying to squeeze in some quality time together, we stumbled upon an old habit that reignited our connection – virtual game nights! Yes, you read that right. We'd play online board games, like Catan or Ticket to Ride, from the comfort of our own homes. It was a brilliant way to spend some quality time together, minus the distractions of dinner at a restaurant or a movie night out.As we played, we discovered that this format allowed us to truly focus on each other – no phone notifications, no TV in the background, just pure interaction. We'd chat, strategize, and even laugh together over silly moves. It was an incredible way to bond, even as our schedules continued to get increasingly busy.What struck me most about this experience was how it highlighted the importance of finding common ground – or, in our case, a shared interest that we could both enjoy. As life gets busier, it's easy to lose sight of what brought us together in the first place. That's why I'd love for you to share with me: What's one thing that you and your partner used to do regularly, but haven't had time for lately? Let's brainstorm ways to bring back those cherished moments!
