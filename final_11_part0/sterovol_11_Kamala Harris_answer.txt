Have you ever cut someone out of your life because of their views on climate change?
    
I remember it was about 2015 when I started to notice a significant shift in my social circle. It seemed like everyone around me, including some close friends and acquaintances, were becoming increasingly dismissive of the importance of addressing climate change.One person who particularly stuck out to me was my coworker, Alex. We had always gotten along well, but as time went on, I noticed that he would often downplay or even deny the severity of climate change. He'd say things like "it's just a natural cycle" or "we can't afford to make changes." Every conversation about climate change with him would end with me feeling frustrated and unheard.I tried talking to him multiple times, but it seemed like he wasn't willing to listen. It was as if his views on climate change had become a kind of ideological shield, making him defensive against any opposing viewpoints.Eventually, I realized that continuing to be friends with Alex might not be the healthiest for me. Not because I wanted to "win" an argument or prove a point, but because I felt like being around someone who actively undermined the importance of climate action was counterproductive to my own goals and values.I made the difficult decision to distance myself from Alex and focus on surrounding myself with people who shared my passion for sustainability. It wasn't easy, but it allowed me to build stronger relationships with others who were working towards a common goal.Looking back, I'm not sure if cutting someone out of your life is ever an easy or clean decision. But what I do know is that being true to yourself and your values can be incredibly liberating â€“ and maybe even spark some important conversations with others. What's your take on this? Do you have any experiences with navigating tough social situations related to climate change?
